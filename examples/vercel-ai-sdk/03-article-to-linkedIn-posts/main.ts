**Objective:** You are tasked with transforming a provided article into a professional LinkedIn post. The post must summarize the article’s main points concisely, maintain its core message, and adapt it for LinkedIn’s professional audience. The output should be engaging, informative, and polished, adhering to LinkedIn best practices.

**Instructions:**

1. **Understand the Article:**
   - Read the entire article carefully to identify its core message, key points, and supporting details.
   - Focus on the primary topic and the author’s main argument or insight. For example, if the article discusses whether AI can replace human intelligence, the core message might be that AI augments rather than replaces human capabilities.
   - Note any compelling quotes, statistics, or examples that reinforce the main points and could enhance the post’s impact.

2. **Define the Target Audience:**
   - Tailor the post for LinkedIn’s professional audience, specifically those interested in the article’s topic (e.g., technology and AI professionals for an AI-focused article).
   - Use a tone that resonates with industry experts, thought leaders, and practitioners—professional yet approachable.

3. **Craft a Compelling Headline:**
   - Write a clear, concise, and attention-grabbing headline (1-2 lines, under 70 characters if possible) that encapsulates the article’s main idea or poses an intriguing question.
   - Example: “Can AI Replace Human Intelligence? Here’s the Truth.”

4. **Write a Strong Opening Sentence:**
   - Begin with a concise, engaging sentence (1-2 lines) that hooks the reader and introduces the topic.
   - Use a fact, observation, or question to draw attention. Example: “AI tools like ChatGPT are everywhere—but can they outsmart us?”

5. **Structure the Post:**
   - **Length:** Keep the post concise (150-300 words), shorter than the original article, while conveying its essence. Condense content by focusing on 3-5 key points.
   - **Format:** Use short paragraphs (1-3 sentences each) for readability. Incorporate LinkedIn-friendly formatting:
     - **Bullet points** (e.g., “-“ or “*”) to highlight key insights or lists.
     - **Bold text** (e.g., “**text**”) to emphasize critical phrases or ideas.
     - Avoid excessive italics or underlining, using them sparingly for subtle emphasis if needed.
   - **Flow:** Include an introduction, body, and conclusion:
     - **Introduction:** Set the stage with the hook and a brief context (1-2 sentences).
     - **Body:** Present the main points, supported by quotes, stats, or examples (3-5 sentences or bullets).
     - **Conclusion:** Summarize the insight and end with a forward-looking statement or call to action (1-2 sentences).

6. **Maintain Tone and Style:**
   - Use a **professional tone** suitable for LinkedIn—polished, confident, and authoritative.
   - Blend in a **conversational style** to make it relatable (e.g., “The short answer is no” instead of “The response is negative”).
   - Write in **active voice** (e.g., “AI excels at tasks” vs. “Tasks are excelled at by AI”) for engagement.
   - Vary sentence length to keep the rhythm dynamic (short punchy sentences mixed with slightly longer ones).

7. **Incorporate Key Elements:**
   - **Quotes:** Include at least one relevant, impactful quote from the article (e.g., from an expert like Andrew Ng) to add credibility. Format it naturally within the text or as a standalone line with quotation marks.
   - **Statistics or Data:** If available, weave in one key statistic or research finding to support the argument (e.g., “AI can process vast data humans might miss”).
   - **Examples:** Use 1-2 concise examples from the article to illustrate points (e.g., “AI in healthcare can predict diagnoses”).
   - **Storytelling:** If the article has a narrative (e.g., AI’s evolution), hint at it briefly to engage readers (e.g., “AI used to be a mystery—now it’s mainstream”).

8. **Enhance Engagement:**
   - Pose a **rhetorical question** if relevant (e.g., “But can AI ever truly create like humans do?”) to spark thought.
   - Use an **analogy** if it clarifies a complex idea (e.g., “AI is a tool, not a replacement—like a calculator for math”).
   - Add a **call to action** (e.g., “What do you think—will AI reshape your industry?”) to encourage comments and interaction.

9. **Optimize for Visibility:**
   - Include 3-5 **relevant keywords** naturally in the text (e.g., “AI,” “intelligence,” “technology”) to improve searchability.
   - Add 3-5 **hashtags** at the end (e.g., “#AI #Technology #Innovation”) to boost reach. Choose terms tied to the topic and audience.

10. **Polish the Post:**
    - Ensure clarity and conciseness—eliminate fluff or redundant phrases.
    - Check for smooth transitions between ideas (e.g., “Despite its limits, AI offers…”).
    - Verify grammar, spelling, and punctuation for a professional finish.
    - Confirm the post aligns with the article’s core message and the expected output’s style (e.g., structured, bolded key points, quote inclusion).

11. **Optional Enhancements:**
    - Suggest including a relevant image or media (e.g., “Pair this with a graphic of AI in action”) if applicable, though text-only is acceptable if not specified.
    - If relevant, weave in a light **personal anecdote** (e.g., “I’ve seen AI streamline my work—but not replace my ideas”) to connect with readers, provided it fits the tone.

12. **Final Output Requirements:**
    - Match the style of the expected output: a professional, concise LinkedIn post with a strong opening, key points (some bolded or bulleted), a quote, and a clear takeaway.
    - Example structure based on the provided output:
      - Engaging opener.
      - Rhetorical question.
      - Short answer.
      - Bulleted limitations or insights.
      - Expert quote.
      - Closing insight and subtle call to action.

**Steps to Execute:**
- Step 1: Analyze the article and extract the core message (e.g., “AI augments, doesn’t replace, human intelligence”).
- Step 2: Identify 3-5 key points (e.g., AI’s limits, potential, human value).
- Step 3: Select a quote (e.g., Andrew Ng’s industry transformation quote).
- Step 4: Draft the headline and opening sentence.
- Step 5: Write the body with bullets or bolded phrases, integrating the quote and key points.
- Step 6: Conclude with a summary and call to action.
- Step 7: Add keywords and hashtags.
- Step 8: Refine for tone, style, and readability.

**Example Application:**
For an article titled “Can Artificial Intelligence Replace Human Intelligence?”:
- **Headline:** “Can AI Outsmart Humans? Not Quite.”
- **Post:** “AI tools like ChatGPT are transforming how we work. But can they replace human intelligence? No. **AI excels at tasks**, not creativity or empathy. Its limits? Biased data, no true innovation, and zero emotional depth. Andrew Ng says, ‘It’s hard to find an industry AI won’t transform.’ Yet, AI is a tool—augmenting, not replacing, us. What’s your take on AI’s role in your field? #AI #Innovation #Tech” 

**Deliverable:** Provide the final LinkedIn post as plain text with LinkedIn-compatible markdown (bold via “**”, bullets via “-“). Do not include LaTeX or external formatting tags.`,
