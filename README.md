# 🌀 AI Spirals Rebuilt with Vercel AI SDK  

This repository is a reconstruction of select **Spirals** from [Spiral](https://spiral.computer) using **Vercel's AI SDK**. Spiral is a platform that converts one form of content into another using AI. For example, it can transform an **article** into an engaging **YouTube video script**.  

In this repository, I recreated some of my favorite Spirals using **TypeScript** and **Vercel's AI SDK** to achieve similar content transformations.

## 🚀 What This Repository Does  

This repository contains several AI-powered **Spirals** that convert one form of content into another. Below are the specific Spirals I rebuilt:  

### ✅ **Article → YouTube Video Script**  
**Input:** Long-form article or blog post.  
**Output:** A complete YouTube video script that summarizes and captures the core message of the article in an engaging format.  

I plan to add more Spirals in the future or optimize the existing ones.

## 💻 How It Works  

The entire project is built using:  

- **Vercel AI SDK** - Provides seamless AI API integration to build powerful content generation pipelines.  
- **TypeScript** - Ensures type safety and clean code structure.  
- **Google Gemini API (via Vercel AI SDK)** - Handles text transformations by prompting a large language model (LLM).

## 📜 Why I Built This  

I found **Spiral** to be an incredibly powerful tool for converting text-based content into other forms of content. However, I was particularly curious about **how they worked under the hood** — especially their prompting techniques and content transformation pipelines.  

So, I decided to **rebuild some of their Spirals** using **Vercel's AI SDK**. This allowed me to:  

1. **Understand the mechanics of content transformation.**  
2. **Explore Vercel's AI SDK capabilities in a practical project.**  
3. **Replicate Spiral's impressive functionality in an open-source context.**
